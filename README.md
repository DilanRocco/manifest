# the-app
the app we are all taking about
test
## Ideas for websites to build
- I really like the idea of creating some fun app that can apply for my personal domain
- train tracker of Boston (extensible to NY)
- notes app
- a reminders app that actually does everything you want
- the headspace app where you can listen to your manifestations
- personal project webiste

perhaps we can intergrate whatever we build into the personal project website
