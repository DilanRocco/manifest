> A way to *trick* your brain to go from where you are now to where you want to be.

## How to Manifest


Manifesting is listening or reading positive thoughts. You are the one who creates these thoughts. In this app, we provide you with the ability to listen or read to your prompts - choosing between listening or reading is mostly a preference. A manifest can come in many different forms. When getting started for the first time, it's suggested to start with many one lined sentences with assertive claims. These claims are places are you want to be in the future. As a general thought, push further. Go from something like 'I am good at Basketball' to 'I am the best basketball player I've ever seen' As a more advanced approach, you can start with multi-line more complex thoughts. There are some initial examples below on where to start.


- 'I can get whatever I put my mind towards'


- 'I know my opinion is valued in the book club meeeting every Wednesday'


- 'I am someone who makes people's day better'


Start to consistently listen to these manifests. Pick a time every day to play these thoughts back. The app stores your previous manifests. Within a week, you can start to see the impact. Now imagine if you did it for a year..


## Background

Manifesting is immersed throughout our culture and is widely recognized. For example, the book *Secret* by Rhonda Byrne is all about manifesting and says that when you manifest, your thoughts traverse into reality to create a gravitational pull towards you.

In the bible it's states
> Mark 11:24: “Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”

Many also believe this whole concept is placebo.


No matter why you think manifesting works, it has a positive efffect.
