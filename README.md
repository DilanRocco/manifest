> A way to *trick* your brain to go from where you are now to where you want to be.

## How to Manifest

Manifesting is listening or reading postiive thoughts. You are the one who creates these phrases. 

'I can get whatever I put my mind towards'

'I know people like me before I even talk to them'

'I am someone who makes people's day better'


## Background 

The book *Secret* by Rhonda Byrne claims when you manifest your thoughts and  creates a pull similar to gravity   

In the bible it's states
- Mark 11:24: “Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”

Or maybe it's just placebo...

No matter why you think this appraoch works, it works.
