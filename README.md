> A way to *trick* your brain to go from where you are now to where you want to be.

## How to Manifest

Manifesting is listening or reading positive thoughts. You are the one who creates these phrases. In this app, we provide you with the ability to listen or read to your prompts - it's mostly preference. A manifest can come in many different forms. When getting started for the first time, it's stuggested to start with short simple sentences strating with asserative claims. These claims are places are you want to be in the future. As a general thought, push further. Go from something like 'I am good at Basketball' to 'I am the best basketball player I've ever seen'. As a more advanced approach, you can start with mutli-line more complex thoughts. There are some inital exmaples below on where to start. 

'I can get whatever I put my mind towards'

'I know people like me before I even talk to them'

'I am someone who makes people's day better'

## Background 

The book *Secret* by Rhonda Byrne claims when you manifest your thoughts and  creates a pull similar to gravity   

In the bible it's states
> Mark 11:24: “Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”

Or maybe it's just placebo...

No matter why you think this appraoch works, it works.
